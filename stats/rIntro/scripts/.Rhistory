#### (1) Setup initial directory structure -------------------------------------
## Start by setting your working directory to your psy1903 folder. Replace "~/Desktop/" with the correct path to your psy1903 directory:
setwd("~/Desktop/psy1903/")
## Create a new parent directory called "stats" where we will be doing all of our R work:
dir.create("stats/")
## Create a new directory called "rIntro" for today's exercises:
dir.create("stats/rIntro")
## Create new subdirectories "data", "scripts", & "output" for today's exercises:
dir.create("stats/rIntro/data")
dir.create("stats/rIntro/scripts")
dir.create("stats/rIntro/output")
## Set working directory to the rIntro/scripts parent directory, which will be our home base for today:
setwd("~/Desktop/psy1903/stats/rIntro/scripts")
## Save this script as R_introduction.R within your scripts directory (you can just use command+S or File → Save As)
nstall.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library("ggplot2")
if (!require("pacman")) {install.packages("pacman"); require("pacman")}  # First install and load in pacman to R
## Then use p_load and a list of all of the packages that you need for the project (with each one being in "quotes")
p_load("tidyverse","rstudioapi","lme4","emmeans","psych","corrplot")  # tidyverse contains many packages like dplyr, tidyr, stringr, and ggplot2, among others, and the additional packages should cover our data manipulations, plotting, and analyses
